Repository for Problem Sets for Yale CPSC 445, Data Mining.

All code will compile on Mac OSX with `gcc -o ps[123].c`

Problem Set 1 is an implementation of the Jacobi one-sided SVD.

Problem Set 2 is an implementation of Gradient Descent on a linear system. In particular, minimizing `||Ax - b||^2` (the routine is called `dumb_solve()` for a reason).

Problem Set 3 is an implementation of k-NN using a QuadTree for points lying in [0,1]x[0,1].
